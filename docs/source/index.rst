Welcome to Psych Head
=====================

This project has been developed within the Action and Perception group of the
school of Psychology at Cardiff University. A new audiovisual lab has been
created and needed a bit of code in order to be analyse the data provided by
the measurements and simulations. [Octave][1] has been chosen for several
reasons:

* Open source software
* Good compatibility with Matlab (used inside the Lab)
* Good toolboxes for signal processing

Please, download it, study it, improve it and share it!
