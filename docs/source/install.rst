Installation
============

At the moment, even if the library isn't a proper package, the installation
process is straight forward. Clone the repository or extract the archive in
your home directory `~/` (or wherever it suits you best) and edit the
`~/Octaverc` file by adding the following line:

.. code-block:: bash

  addpath('<directory/where/are/stored/the/files>')

This will load the library at startup.
